# FEWD Milestone 3 Assessment: Food Preferences Survey Form

## Project Overview
In this milestone assessment, you'll be creating a **Food Preferences Survey Form** using HTML and CSS. This one-hour project is focused on implementing essential form components and applying basic styling to create a user-friendly interface. You'll be provided with the HTML page structure, so your main tasks will be to add specific form elements and apply styles. **Jasmine tests** will verify the successful implementation of each component.
